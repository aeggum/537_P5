I had some time to burn so I went through and added to the rest of mfs.c.  
Most of the file is complete now, but there are a few bits that I wasn't able to get to.  (Such as MFS_Read(), returning the data in the right format).

It looks like the majority of the work is now onto LFS.c.  That will be plenty of fun...

No tests are passing, last time I ran them.  The last couple take forever so I wouldn't recommend just testing all everytime.
