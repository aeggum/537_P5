I have everything set up on github.  Seems like that may make this a bit easier to deal with as a whole.
To set up you'll need to do a few things, if you're interested.
1. Make a github account
2. Do the set up process, found here: http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/
    --> CS already has git installed, but you'll have to do the other stuff
3. I'll add you to the project
4. Fork this repository anywhere you have git (like CS!) http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/  
   It is literally one command..SUPER easy.  
   "git clone git@github.com:aeggum12/537_P5.git" and you have it all!

Some of the git commands that may be useful:
  - 'git add .' -- need to use this when you add a file that you want git to have.
  - 'git commit -am MESSAGE'  -- commits the code, you give a message
  - 'git push origin master'  -- pushes all committed code to github (any changes)
  - 'git pull origin master'  -- pulls all code from github (any changes)


We will have to set up another 'library', though I am not sure what this might mean this time around.  (libmfs.so)
