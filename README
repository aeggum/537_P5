LINUX:
Our network file server does everything that is specified.  The client library 
exports the interfaces in MFS.c.  The client sends packet structures to the 
server, and the server listens on the specified port (for up to 3 seconds) until 
a method of a specified type is received.  Most of the work takes place in lfs.c.

In sending back the packet, the server uses the inum field of the server as a 
return status, and the client checks that field to determine success or failure. 
There are a couple files that have just one method in them, one for the client and
one for the server.  They are separated as we do not have a header file for the client 
or server and this way was easy enough. 

We pass all of the tests, 27 out of 27.  The runtests are saved in runtests.log.



XV6:
We haven't started on this part of the project yet, so it probably passes 2 out
of all of the tests.  Not too shabby. 
We have this part mostly implemented, but we are failing 2 tests, 10 out of 12. 
We do a checksum in writei and check the checksum in readi.  We had to add some 
code to bmap() to get everything working as it is, including the 3-byte shift of
the checksum.  

We are passing 10 out of 12 tests.
